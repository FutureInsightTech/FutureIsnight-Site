<p>DevBox is a script that simplifies the process of setting up a Linux system for development purposes. As a developer, you may find it tedious and time-consuming to configure a new Linux system for development, but with DevBox, you can automate this process. The script is designed to install and configure all the necessary applications and tools that a developer would need to get started quickly. With support for Debian and Arch Linux, DevBox is versatile and can be used on multiple systems. It does not use Snap Pack, ensuring a fast and streamlined installation process. Once the script is executed, you can forget about the installation and focus on your work. DevBox supports AUR and can also be used to theme Gnome desktops. With Git and GitHub configuration, DevBox streamlines the development process. The script is secure, and with its one-line command line execution, it is easy to use even for beginners.</p>
<h1 id="about-application">About Application:</h1>
<p>So the application has 5 different versions, and each version has a unique file structure, permissions, and supports different applications. This means that each version is very different from the others, and requires a different approach to work with. So it&rsquo;s important to understand which version you&rsquo;re working with and what its specific requirements are, in order to effectively use the application.</p>
<h1 id="key-features-of-the-linux-system-configuration-script">Key Features of the Linux System Configuration Script:</h1>

<h2 id="no-use-of-snap-pack">NO Use of Snap Pack</h2>
<p>DevBox does not rely on Snap Packs, which can sometimes cause compatibility issues or performance problems. Instead, DevBox uses the default package manager of your distribution to install the necessary packages and dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="run-once-and-then-forget">Run Once and Then Forget</h2>

<h2 id="support-for-aur">Support for AUR</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using Arch Linux, you can use DevBox to install packages from the Arch User Repository (AUR). This means that you can install packages that are not available in the official repositories of Arch Linux.</p>
<h2 id="working-on-theming-gnome-desktop">Working on theming Gnome Desktop</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using the Gnome desktop environment, DevBox can also configure the theme and appearance of your desktop, giving you a more personalized and streamlined development environment.</p>
<h2 id="installing-multiple-applications-for-developers">Installing Multiple Applications for Developers</h2>
<p>DevBox can install multiple applications that are essential for developers, such as Git, Vim, Python, and Node.js, among others. This means that you don&rsquo;t have to install each application manually.</p>
<h2 id="config-git--github">Config Git &amp; GitHub</h2>
<p>DevBox can also configure Git and GitHub on your system, making it easy for you to use these tools for version control and collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="secure">Secure</h2>
<p>DevBox is designed to be secure and does not compromise the security of your system. It uses only the official package managers of your distribution and does not install any third-party software.</p>
