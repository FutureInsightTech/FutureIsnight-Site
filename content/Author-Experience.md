<h2>Bachelor in Software Engineering</h2>

          <h5>2018 - 2022</h5>
          <p><em>Captial University of Science and Technology, PK</em></p>
          <p align="justify">It is my honor to being a part of one of the best University in the Country. I, never in the wildest of my dreams, could imagine myself being in that university. It was not on my radar list as I was a really average student throughout my school life who was interested in things which were not being taught at school (real life LOL!). I had my eyes set on a particular university and I had literally NO solid reason as to why I was eyeing only that university all this time.</p>
          <p align="justify">The campus of university is huge with stunning and beautiful garden where students and teachers can relax in their free time, The computer labs and Libiaries are always ready and in the environment to get the job done, There is great food, drinks and deserts in the cafeteria. </p>
          <p align="justify">With well experienced Professors, Lab Instructors are will to help the students to improve their studies.</p>
          <p align="justify">In this great learning and relaxing enviroment I got 3.0 CGPA in my 4 years of Degree.</p>
