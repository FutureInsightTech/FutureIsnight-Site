### Introducation:
To be honest, I am new to this world of machine learning, and with time, I will get better. But the thing I hear the most is that I need to read research papers from different authors.

Look at their point of view and then try to figure out how they came up with these ideas and logical conclusions.

So today we will be looking and read some of the research paper, to see if reading them is a good idea or not. The reaech paper I will be reading from a small project and it is based on NLP(Natural Language Processing). 

### What is NLP?
So before reading this research paper I need to understand what is NLP and how is different from other category of Machine Learning.
So to answeer this question I asked my Sir, here what he said.
