      <description>I came across a project, and in that project, I have to different machine learning classifiers or machine learning algorithms. I know how to apply them, but it&amp;rsquo;s been a while, so today I did it., We will revisit all of the concepts of the decision tree, from major terms to code implementation.
Decision Tree Decision Tree is a Supervised Learning technique that can be used for classification problems and regression problems, but mostly it is used for classification problems.</description>

      <description>Logistical regression is a type of algorithm that uses information from one set of data to predict another set. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at what logistical regression is and how it works as well as some popular examples where it&amp;rsquo;s been used successfully.
What is Logistical Regression Logistic regression is a type of regression analysis that is used to predict the probability of an event occurring. It&amp;rsquo;s also known as multinomial logistic regression, and it&amp;rsquo;s used in marketing, fraud detection, and risk assessment.</description>

      <description>Linear regression is a powerful and widely-used statistical technique that can be used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is commonly used in various fields, including economics, social sciences, engineering, and machine learning. Linear regression aims to find the best-fit line that describes the linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, allowing for the prediction of the dependent variable for a given value of the independent variable.</description>

      <title>False Data Injection Attack</title>
      <link>https://future-insight.blog/machine-learning/machine-learning/FDIA/</link>

      <description>False data injection is a type of cyber attack that occurs when an attacker alters or introduces incorrect data into a control system or its communication network. This type of attack can have serious consequences for the operation of the control system, such as loss of control, equipment damage, and even safety incidents.
False data injection attacks can take many forms, including modifying sensor readings, injecting false control commands, or altering historical data records.</description>

      <description>So you are working on text identification or face detection, and the question that arises is which algorithm to use and what will be the performance.
I am doing a project where I need to use SVM for detecting cyber attacks, but in order to identify them, I need to learn what makes this algorithm so good. For this project, I will be learning the basics of SVM with real-world examples, and once we are done with the examples, we will try the real project.</description>

      <description>Hi! My name is Abdul Rafay, and I work on training different models from provided data, as well as deploying the model on any of the cloud services.
When I started this journey, my teacher and mentor told me to learn math and probability in order to understand the major concepts needed to become an expert in machine learning. But most students hate math and probability because some of the concepts can be tricky to learn and might not be interesting to them.</description>

      <description>So, I am currently working on a machine learning and deep learning project. I am new to this field and am still learning, but I will get better with time. However, as I am coding and trying to solve problems, I have realised that there are a few important things that must be understood before beginning development.
Understanding: Those things are: 1. understanding the type of data; and 2. once you know what kind of data this is, you need to check what kind of model you are going to use.</description>

      <description>Hi!, Over the years I have developed multiple websites using multiple technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a couple of frameworks, but now I am expanding my skill set in the world of machine learning. I used JavaScript for everything and loved it; things were very easy and simple for me. I needed to create a static website, so I just used NodeJS with an EJS template to create a simple website.</description>
