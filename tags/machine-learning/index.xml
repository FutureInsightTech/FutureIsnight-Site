      <description>Introduction: So you are working on text identification or face detection, and the question that arises is which algorithm to use and what will be the performance.
I am doing a project where I need to use SVM for detecting cyber attacks, but in order to identify them, I need to learn what makes this algorithm so good. For this project, I will be learning the basics of SVM with real-world examples, and once we are done with the examples, we will try the real project.</description>

      <description>Introduction Machine Learning and Deep Learning are rapidly growing fields that are changing the way we interact with technology. These fields have the power to create intelligent systems that can learn from data and make predictions, decisions, and even create new knowledge. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning about Machine Learning and Deep Learning, there are many resources available to help you get started.
Best Resources As I was learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning, I got to the point where I did not understand the basic knowledge of Machine Learning Models and Deep Learning Models.</description>

      <description>Introduction: Hi! My name is Abdul Rafay, and I work on training different models from provided data, as well as deploying the model on any of the cloud services.
When I started this journey, my teacher and mentor told me to learn math and probability in order to understand the major concepts needed to become an expert in machine learning. But most students hate math and probability because some of the concepts can be tricky to learn and might not be interesting to them.</description>

      <description>Introduction: Learning is something that we have to do every day. As a developer, you need to learn the latest and hottest technologies because if you don&amp;rsquo;t, you might not be able to succeed in this field.
I am a web developer and machine learning engineer. I am working on both and trying to improve my skills with time, but sometimes you need guidance to see where you are right now and where you see yourself in the future.</description>

      <description>Introducation: So, I am currently working on a machine learning and deep learning project. I am new to this field and am still learning, but I will get better with time. However, as I am coding and trying to solve problems, I have realised that there are a few important things that must be understood before beginning development.
Understanding: Those things are: 1. understanding the type of data; and 2. once you know what kind of data this is, you need to check what kind of model you are going to use.</description>

      <description>Introduction: Hi!, Over the years I have developed multiple websites using multiple technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a couple of frameworks, but now I am expanding my skill set in the world of machine learning. I used JavaScript for everything and loved it; things were very easy and simple for me. I needed to create a static website, so I just used NodeJS with an EJS template to create a simple website.</description>
